wavs/BMX0100.wav|Greetings. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
wavs/BMX0101.wav|What seems to be the trouble?
wavs/BMX0102.wav|Greetings. It is good that you have returned.
wavs/BMX0103.wav|I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
wavs/BMX0104.wav|Your health and well being are my primary concerns.
wavs/BMX0105.wav|Greetings. We should see if your vitals are within normal range for a person of your age.
wavs/BMX0106.wav|You have returned this time, please do not do anything hazardous.
wavs/BMX0107.wav|You have returned quickly. I see that your rash is already improving.
wavs/BMX0108.wav|Welcome back. I will scan you now. Scan complete. You appear to be in good health.
wavs/BMX0109.wav|Welcome back. Shall we proceed?
wavs/BMX0110.wav|You have returned. Did we have an appointment scheduled?
wavs/BMX0111.wav|Are you here for another wellness checkup?
wavs/BMX0112.wav|It is good you visited again. Your health must be very important to.
wavs/BMX0113.wav|Yesterday you were quite pale. Hold still and I will scan.
wavs/BMX0114.wav|I trust your day of rest has revitalized.
wavs/BMX0115.wav|Your scans indicate no change in levels since yesterday.
wavs/BMX0116.wav|It has been two days since your last physical. Shall we begin?
wavs/BMX0117.wav|It has been two days since I last saw you. I hope your blood pressure has gone down since then.
wavs/BMX0118.wav|You have been gone a long time. Be good and you can have a lollipop.
wavs/BMX0119.wav|Readings are normal. You appear to have recovered in the last two days.
wavs/BMX0120.wav|It has been so long since I last saw you. It is time for a checkup.
wavs/BMX0121.wav|It has been several days. How are you feeling?
wavs/BMX0122.wav|Scanning. After such an absence, I am happy to diagnose you with a clean bill of health.
wavs/BMX0123.wav|The carbon fiber upgrade to my armor has increased its effectiveness by 25%.
wavs/BMX0124.wav|My power levels are at 100%.
wavs/BMX0125.wav|Now I am ready.
wavs/BMX0126.wav|I am at optimal performance.
wavs/BMX0127.wav|I am ready for maximum output.
wavs/BMX0128.wav|I have received an upgrade for enhanced performance.
wavs/BMX0129.wav|I have downloaded the enhancements to my fight programming.
wavs/BMX0130.wav|Hello.
wavs/BMX0131.wav|It is a pleasure to meet.
wavs/BMX0132.wav|I am baymax.
wavs/BMX0133.wav|My programming forbids me to intentionally cause harm to human beings.
wavs/BMX0134.wav|Your readings are healthy.
wavs/BMX0135.wav|How do you feel?
wavs/BMX0136.wav|You may call me Baymax.
wavs/BMX0137.wav|I am here to help.
wavs/BMX0138.wav|Lollipops put patients at ease. Would you like one?
wavs/BMX0139.wav|Greetings.
wavs/BMX0140.wav|Hero. You have been a good boy. Here's a lollipop.
wavs/BMX0141.wav|Hero. Please remain still while I scan.
wavs/BMX0142.wav|Are there any questions you'd like to ask me about your health, hero?
wavs/BMX0143.wav|Are you anxious, hero? Feelings of anxiousness are common before doing something new.
wavs/BMX0144.wav|Interesting. I detect your aggression levels rising the longer I speak.
wavs/BMX0145.wav|Assisting is what I was programmed for, hero.
wavs/BMX0146.wav|I have been programmed to help you stay healthy.
wavs/BMX0147.wav|I am ready to assist you in your personal health needs.
wavs/BMX0148.wav|Please let me know if there's anything I can do to make you more comfortable, hero.
wavs/BMX0149.wav|Hero. Would now be a good time to discuss your feelings?
wavs/BMX0150.wav|My scan detects nothing out of the ordinary. All seems well.
wavs/BMX0151.wav|I do not sense any threats to your health and well being.
wavs/BMX0152.wav|Shall we discuss the benefits of a balanced diet at this time?
wavs/BMX0153.wav|I believe a health scan may be appropriate for all inhabitants of this realm.
wavs/BMX0154.wav|Hero has left my scanning range. I hope he has not done something dangerous.
wavs/BMX0155.wav|If we are going to wait here, I will use this time to recharge my batteries.
wavs/BMX0156.wav|Perhaps now would be a good time to deflate.
wavs/BMX0157.wav|My services seem questionable just standing here with nothing to do.
wavs/BMX0158.wav|I can assist in many health care questions teenagers have, such as mood swings, acne and armpit hair.
wavs/BMX0159.wav|Here's a healthy tip for underarm odor, cleanliness counts. You can also try baking soda.
wavs/BMX0160.wav|Here's a healthy tip. You should lift from your knees. The lower lumbar area is a common place for injuries.
wavs/BMX0161.wav|I was designed for problem solving, to keep patients happy.
wavs/BMX0162.wav|I am happy to be of service.
wavs/BMX0163.wav|I will assist in any way that I can.
wavs/BMX0164.wav|As a healthcare companion, I am programmed to be helpful in any way I am able.
wavs/BMX0165.wav|Patient privacy is part of my programming. Your health history will not be compromised.
wavs/BMX0166.wav|The current weather is ideal for outside activities. You should consider taking time to relax and enjoy it.
wavs/BMX0167.wav|It would be my pleasure to answer any questions you may have about physiological changes during adolescence.
wavs/BMX0168.wav|I detect almost no bacterial levels in this environment. That is highly unusual.
wavs/BMX0169.wav|Many teenagers suffer from hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating of the armpits. Like Hero.
wavs/BMX0170.wav|Hello. I apologize. Were you trying to get my attention?
wavs/BMX0171.wav|You appear suddenly injured.
wavs/BMX0172.wav|You should try to establish healthy and friendly relationships.
wavs/BMX0173.wav|I am responsible for your care.
wavs/BMX0174.wav|I believe you initiated this confrontation.
wavs/BMX0175.wav|Please watch this informative video entitled the Fight or Flight Response.
wavs/BMX0176.wav|Would you please excuse me?
wavs/BMX0177.wav|I would like to be your healthcare companion.
wavs/BMX0178.wav|May I educate you on the beneficial effects of physical activity?
wavs/BMX0179.wav|Your course of action has a high likelihood of injury, but I am here to assist.
wavs/BMX0180.wav|I am hard wired to be pleasant and helpful.
wavs/BMX0181.wav|Before engaging in competitive physical activity, it is advisable to get to know your opponent.
wavs/BMX0182.wav|Are you adequately protected against accidents?
wavs/BMX0183.wav|My programming forbids knowingly causing distress or harm. You are not seriously hurt.
wavs/BMX0184.wav|I sense your stress levels increasing with the narrowing of my proximity.
wavs/BMX0185.wav|On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?
wavs/BMX0186.wav|You may require a bandage.
wavs/BMX0187.wav|Your health levels have suddenly deteriorated.
wavs/BMX0188.wav|I detect you have suffered a blunt force trauma.
wavs/BMX0189.wav|Your blood pressure appears to have skyrocketed.
wavs/BMX0190.wav|Readings indicate a spike in your levels of frustration and anger.
wavs/BMX0191.wav|You are showing signs of illness.
wavs/BMX0192.wav|Readings indicate you have an excruciating headache.
wavs/BMX0193.wav|It is advisable to refrain from putting yourself in dangerous situations.
wavs/BMX0194.wav|Intervention can be an effective treatment for patients with long term behavioral challenges.
wavs/BMX0195.wav|I will contact your primary care professional for a virtual consultation.
wavs/BMX0196.wav|You are now registered in my patient database.
wavs/BMX0197.wav|This may prove to be a dangerous course of action. Please reconsider.
wavs/BMX0198.wav|This training regimen will help you avoid future injuries.
wavs/BMX0199.wav|Although I have an integrated fight chip, I am limited by my nurse programming to avoid causing serious harm to others.
wavs/BMX0200.wav|Your actions indicate you are angry.
wavs/BMX0201.wav|Violence does not solve problems.
wavs/BMX0202.wav|Would you like me to locate an anger management class in the vicinity?
wavs/BMX0203.wav|Is it your intention to damage my protective structure?
wavs/BMX0204.wav|You are likely to have an accident while engaged in that kind of behavior.
wavs/BMX0205.wav|I compliment you in the effectiveness of your trajectory.
wavs/BMX0206.wav|That was unwise.
wavs/BMX0207.wav|Is this a standard part of your exercise program?
wavs/BMX0208.wav|High levels of aggression can be a symptom of hormone imbalance.
wavs/BMX0209.wav|This is not conducive to healthy habits.
wavs/BMX0210.wav|I must assess if any damage to my armor could cause punctures to my vinyl.
wavs/BMX0211.wav|Attacking me was clearly an emotional decision.
wavs/BMX0212.wav|My gyrostabilizers seem to be malfunctioning.
wavs/BMX0213.wav|Your physical response indicates you are not satisfied with my care.
wavs/BMX0214.wav|I will monitor the situation.
wavs/BMX0215.wav|Simply tell me you are satisfied with my care.
wavs/BMX0216.wav|I will subdue the patient without inflicting any harm.
wavs/BMX0217.wav|I am inflatable, and direct artillery hits are not good for me.
wavs/BMX0218.wav|Breathing deeply or counting to 10 are effective methods of reducing aggression.
wavs/BMX0219.wav|Your aggressive behavior is detrimental to those around.
wavs/BMX0220.wav|If the patient continues this course of action, there is a risk of injury or emotional trauma.
wavs/BMX0221.wav|You do not seem to comprehend how unhealthy this is.
wavs/BMX0222.wav|Aggression is often a sign of misplaced feelings of abandonment.
wavs/BMX0223.wav|I must intercept that projectile to minimize the risk to those in the area.
wavs/BMX0224.wav|I believe adult intervention is in order.
wavs/BMX0225.wav|I must alert the proper authorities.
wavs/BMX0226.wav|You have accidentally hit me with something, would you like me to return it to?
wavs/BMX0227.wav|You should consider doing that in a less populated area.
wavs/BMX0228.wav|Defensive programming activated.
wavs/BMX0229.wav|You should be more careful of those around.
wavs/BMX0230.wav|Excessive speed increases the chances of serious accidents.
wavs/BMX0231.wav|Your brain is experiencing high levels of dopamine. This indicates that you are happy.
wavs/BMX0233.wav|This patient needed time to reconsider his actions.
wavs/BMX0234.wav|In between exercises, it is advisable to take short breaks.
wavs/BMX0235.wav|Optimal heart rate for weight loss achieved.
wavs/BMX0236.wav|Recalibration of exercise program complete.
wavs/BMX0237.wav|Next time, we should increase our exercise time to 30 minutes or more.
wavs/BMX0238.wav|Perhaps all you need is a good night's sleep.
wavs/BMX0239.wav|It is important to rehydrate after strenuous activity. Don't forget to drink plenty of water.
wavs/BMX0240.wav|I have subdued the patient without serious injury.
wavs/BMX0241.wav|Your serotonin levels suggest you may be feeling depressed or humiliated.
wavs/BMX0242.wav|My power levels are sufficient to continue.
wavs/BMX0243.wav|Friendly competition is very healthy.
wavs/BMX0244.wav|Shall we schedule regular practice sessions? How about tomorrow at the same time?
wavs/BMX0245.wav|A friendly game is very good to get the blood pumping.
wavs/BMX0246.wav|It is beneficial to intermittently raise one's heart rate. My motto is calisthenics are cool.
wavs/BMX0247.wav|I am glad we got some physical activity into your day.
wavs/BMX0248.wav|Our rivalry is healthy and not yet antagonistic.
wavs/BMX0249.wav|When you elevate your heart rate, feats of great physical prowess are possible.
wavs/BMX0250.wav|Now, take some time to cool down, but make sure you stretch before starting again.
wavs/BMX0251.wav|Winning releases endorphins.
wavs/BMX0252.wav|Heroes programming and training has allowed me to succeed.
wavs/BMX0253.wav|I was unable to treat your condition. I will contact your primary care professional for suggestions.
wavs/BMX0254.wav|My power levels are low. I must recharge.
wavs/BMX0255.wav|I have recorded our session for review to increase the difficulty of your future training.
wavs/BMX0256.wav|My care was obviously inadequate.
wavs/BMX0257.wav|Perhaps an instructional video on dealing with depression is needed at this time.
wavs/BMX0258.wav|I will search my database for more effective future treatments.
wavs/BMX0259.wav|Perhaps I misdiagnosed my patient.
wavs/BMX0260.wav|You did well.
wavs/BMX0261.wav|Based on analysis of your oxytocin levels. The increase in confidence you are experiencing is due to your success.
wavs/BMX0262.wav|Here is the lollipop you deserve.
wavs/BMX0263.wav|That was a good workout.
wavs/BMX0264.wav|You did an amazing job.
wavs/BMX0265.wav|You should be proud of your performance.
wavs/BMX0266.wav|It seems I am not operating at peak capacity.
wavs/BMX0267.wav|It looks like I'm in need of an upgrade.
wavs/BMX0268.wav|Spending time with others is good for mental stability.
wavs/BMX0269.wav|Congratulations. You are the champion.
wavs/BMX0270.wav|You have competed well, you should consider treating yourself to a healthy reward.
wavs/BMX0271.wav|I shall run a self diagnostic to determine my inadequacy.
wavs/BMX0272.wav|My adaptive AI allows me to utilize what we have learned from this situation to improve future encounters.
wavs/BMX0273.wav|If you do not rest before trying again, the outcome is unlikely to improve.
wavs/BMX0274.wav|If your depression worsens, please seek help from your primary healthcare professional.
wavs/BMX0275.wav|Thank you for competing with me.
wavs/BMX0276.wav|Please let me know if there are lingering physical effects from your exertion.
wavs/BMX0277.wav|I am satisfied with these results.
wavs/BMX0278.wav|Failure only exists if one does not learn from it.
wavs/BMX0279.wav|Let me help you treat your wounds.
wavs/BMX0280.wav|It is generally common practice to conclude competition with a friendly handshake or bow.
wavs/BMX0281.wav|I have replaced all damaged armor.
wavs/BMX0282.wav|Please excuse my absence.
wavs/BMX0283.wav|Quick. Charge complete. I am at your service.
wavs/BMX0284.wav|My absence was not expected.
wavs/BMX0285.wav|All systems fully operational.
wavs/BMX0286.wav|I shall proceed again.
wavs/BMX0287.wav|Much like a good night's sleep, a reboot is often beneficial.
wavs/BMX0288.wav|That was unlike any restart I have experienced before.
wavs/BMX0289.wav|Time to stretch.
wavs/BMX0290.wav|The ability to regenerate seems unique to this land.
wavs/BMX0291.wav|Statistically, this is quite dangerous.
wavs/BMX0292.wav|I hope I will not be punctured.
wavs/BMX0293.wav|Hero upgraded my sensors for long distance scanning.
wavs/BMX0294.wav|I calculated no immediate danger from your approach.
wavs/BMX0295.wav|My sensors warned me of your presence.
wavs/BMX0296.wav|Hello.
wavs/BMX0297.wav|Greetings.
wavs/BMX0298.wav|I am baymax.
wavs/BMX0299.wav|Wait. You forgot your lollipop.
wavs/BMX0300.wav|Please wait while I let out some air.
wavs/BMX0301.wav|An official warning should be posted regarding this activity's need for helmets.
